# Solution for Authentication Issues on Vercel Deployment

## Problem Summary

The authentication system (registration and login) is not working on the deployed Vercel application. This is because the application is configured to use a local MongoDB connection (`mongodb://localhost:27017/simantek`) which works in development but fails when deployed to Vercel since Vercel functions cannot connect to your local database.

Additionally, there's a "failed to fetch" error when trying to register, which indicates that the frontend cannot connect to the backend API routes.

## Root Causes

1. **Database Connection**: The application uses a local MongoDB connection which is not accessible from Vercel
2. **Environment Variables**: Production environment variables are not properly configured in Vercel
3. **API URL Configuration**: The `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` environment variable is not properly set
4. **Error Handling**: Limited error feedback makes it difficult to diagnose issues

## Solution Overview

The solution involves four main steps:

1. Set up MongoDB Atlas (cloud MongoDB service) for production
2. Configure environment variables in Vercel
3. Fix API URL configuration issues
4. Improve error handling for better debugging

## Detailed Solution

### 1. Set up MongoDB Atlas

Follow the instructions in [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md) to:

- Create a MongoDB Atlas account
- Set up a database cluster
- Configure database access and network permissions
- Get your MongoDB connection string

### 2. Configure Vercel Environment Variables

In your Vercel project settings, add these environment variables:

```
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/simantek
MONGODB_DB=simantek
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://your-vercel-app.vercel.app
```

Replace:
- `mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/simantek` with your actual MongoDB Atlas connection string
- `https://your-vercel-app.vercel.app` with your actual Vercel deployment URL

**Important**: The `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` should be your Vercel deployment URL WITHOUT the `/api` suffix. The API client will automatically append `/api` to this URL.

### 3. Code Improvements Made

We've made several improvements to help with debugging and error handling:

#### Backend Improvements

- Enhanced MongoDB connection with better error handling and configuration options
- Improved error messages in authentication API routes
- Better logging for debugging authentication issues

#### Frontend Improvements

- Enhanced error handling in login and registration pages
- More specific error messages for users
- Better feedback when authentication fails

#### API Client Improvements

- Better error handling with more specific error messages
- Improved parsing of error responses from the server

### 4. Fixing the "Failed to Fetch" Error

The "failed to fetch" error is specifically caused by the frontend being unable to connect to the backend API routes. This is typically due to one of these issues:

1. **Incorrect API URL**: The `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` environment variable is not set correctly in Vercel
2. **CORS Issues**: Cross-origin resource sharing issues between frontend and backend
3. **Network Connectivity**: Issues with Vercel function execution

#### How to Fix:

1. **Verify Environment Variables in Vercel**:
   - Go to your Vercel project dashboard
   - Navigate to "Settings" â†’ "Environment Variables"
   - Ensure `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` is set to your Vercel deployment URL (e.g., `https://your-app.vercel.app`)
   - Ensure `MONGODB_URI` is set to your MongoDB Atlas connection string

2. **Check Vercel Deployment URL**:
   - Your Vercel deployment URL should look like: `https://your-app-name.vercel.app`
   - Do NOT include `/api` in the `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` variable

3. **Redeploy Your Application**:
   - After setting the environment variables, redeploy your application
   - Make sure to trigger a new deployment, not just a redeploy of the previous build

## Testing the Fix

After implementing the solution:

1. Deploy your application to Vercel
2. Set the environment variables as described above
3. Try to register a new user
4. Try to log in with the newly created user

## Common Issues and Troubleshooting

### "Failed to connect to database"

- Check that `MONGODB_URI` is correctly set in Vercel environment variables
- Verify the MongoDB Atlas connection string is correct
- Ensure the database user credentials are correct
- Check that your IP address is whitelisted in MongoDB Atlas

### "Invalid credentials" during login

- Verify that users exist in the database
- Check that passwords are properly hashed
- Ensure the username and password match exactly (case-sensitive)

### Registration fails with "Username or email already exists"

- This is expected behavior when trying to register with existing credentials
- Use a different username/email combination

### "Failed to fetch" when calling API routes

- Verify that `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` is correctly set in Vercel environment variables
- Ensure the URL matches your actual Vercel deployment URL
- Check that the URL does not include `/api` (this is automatically appended)
- Redeploy your application after setting environment variables
