# Solution for Authentication Issues on Vercel Deployment

## Problem Summary

The authentication system (registration and login) is not working on the deployed Vercel application. This is because the application is configured to use a local MongoDB connection (`mongodb://localhost:27017/simantek`) which works in development but fails when deployed to Vercel since Vercel functions cannot connect to your local database.

## Root Causes

1. **Database Connection**: The application uses a local MongoDB connection which is not accessible from Vercel
2. **Environment Variables**: Production environment variables are not properly configured in Vercel
3. **Error Handling**: Limited error feedback makes it difficult to diagnose issues

## Solution Overview

The solution involves three main steps:

1. Set up MongoDB Atlas (cloud MongoDB service) for production
2. Configure environment variables in Vercel
3. Improve error handling for better debugging

## Detailed Solution

### 1. Set up MongoDB Atlas

Follow the instructions in [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md) to:

- Create a MongoDB Atlas account
- Set up a database cluster
- Configure database access and network permissions
- Get your MongoDB connection string

### 2. Configure Vercel Environment Variables

In your Vercel project settings, add these environment variables:

```
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/simantek
MONGODB_DB=simantek
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://your-vercel-app.vercel.app/api
```

Replace the `MONGODB_URI` with your actual MongoDB Atlas connection string.

### 3. Code Improvements Made

We've made several improvements to help with debugging and error handling:

#### Backend Improvements

- Enhanced MongoDB connection with better error handling and configuration options
- Improved error messages in authentication API routes
- Better logging for debugging authentication issues

#### Frontend Improvements

- Enhanced error handling in login and registration pages
- More specific error messages for users
- Better feedback when authentication fails

## Testing the Fix

After implementing the solution:

1. Deploy your application to Vercel
2. Set the environment variables as described above
3. Try to register a new user
4. Try to log in with the newly created user

## Common Issues and Troubleshooting

### "Failed to connect to database"

- Check that `MONGODB_URI` is correctly set in Vercel environment variables
- Verify the MongoDB Atlas connection string is correct
- Ensure the database user credentials are correct
- Check that your IP address is whitelisted in MongoDB Atlas

### "Invalid credentials" during login

- Verify that users exist in the database
- Check that passwords are properly hashed
- Ensure the username and password match exactly (case-sensitive)

### Registration fails with "Username or email already exists"

- This is expected behavior when trying to register with existing credentials
- Use a different username/email combination
