# Solution for Authentication Issues - Static Implementation

## Problem Summary

The authentication system (registration and login) was not working on the deployed Vercel application because it was configured to use MongoDB, which requires proper setup and configuration for deployment.

## Solution Overview

The solution involves switching to a static data implementation that doesn't require a database connection. This eliminates all deployment issues related to database connectivity.

## Detailed Solution

### 1. Static Data Implementation

We've replaced the MongoDB database with static data stored in memory:

- Created static user data structure with predefined users
- Modified all models to use static data instead of MongoDB
- Updated authentication functions to work with static data
- Removed all MongoDB-related files and dependencies

### 2. Predefined Users

The application now comes with predefined users for immediate testing:

1. **Admin User**
   - Username: admin
   - Password: password
   - Role: admin

2. **Penyuluh User**
   - Username: penyuluh
   - Password: password
   - Role: penyuluh

3. **Peternak User**
   - Username: peternak
   - Password: password
   - Role: peternak

### 3. Code Improvements Made

We've made several improvements to simplify the application:

#### Backend Improvements

- Removed all MongoDB dependencies and related code
- Created static data models for all entities (users, articles, livestock, etc.)
- Simplified authentication system using static data
- Removed database connection code and related environment variables

#### Frontend Improvements

- No changes needed to frontend code as API routes still work the same way
- Authentication flow remains the same from the user's perspective

#### Environment Configuration

- Removed MongoDB-related environment variables
- Simplified environment configuration to only include essential settings

### 4. Benefits of Static Implementation

1. **No Database Setup Required**: Eliminates all database configuration issues
2. **Simplified Deployment**: No need to configure MongoDB Atlas or any database service
3. **Faster Development**: No database connection delays or issues
4. **Easier Testing**: Predefined data makes testing more predictable
5. **Reduced Dependencies**: Removed MongoDB and related packages

## Testing the Solution

After implementing the static solution:

1. Start the development server with `npm run dev`
2. Visit the login page (`/login`)
3. Log in with one of the predefined users
4. Test registration functionality (note: data is not persisted between server restarts)

## Common Issues and Troubleshooting

### Login Issues

- Ensure you're using the correct predefined usernames and passwords
- Check that you're using the right role for each user
- Verify that the application is running without errors

### Registration Issues

- Registration works but data is not persisted between server restarts
- This is expected behavior for the static implementation
- For production use, a proper database implementation would be needed
